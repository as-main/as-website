			<h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
			<p>Remember last time you tried using an app that functioned like a website? Activator Studios designs mobile apps that are task-focused with clean user interfaces. Apps that clearly communicate their purpose. Ones with intuitive ease of use. We develop mobile applications as extensions of websites, reliable and useful tools, or entertaining time-killers. Just not all three in one app.</p>
